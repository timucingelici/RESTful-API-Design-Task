# RESTful API Design Task

This was an API design task for one of the interviews I did. The original documentation can be found (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1isgcjzvutys1Gl7LNJu01EL1oFB4t5vf3ykg8j0o7Vs/edit?usp=sharing)[here]

Unfortunatelly the image link they have provided is not available anymore but it was giving a database structure and ask to design the API based on that.
